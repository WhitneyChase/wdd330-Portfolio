 Ch2: Programming basics. 
Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops.
•	Arrays seem pretty straight forward and understandable. 
•	Accessing multidimensional arrays was pretty cool and seems like the simplicity would come in handy. 
o	// learning to push onto a multi-dimensional arrya
o	var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];
o	
o	// adding another array to the list of arrays
o	
o	myArray.push(["dog", 3]); 
•	If statements are interesting, there is an option to have no else statements to provide different returns. Instead javascript will just jump to the next executable command and run it.  
 Ch4: Functions
•	You can call a javascript function the same way as c++ 
o	function functionName() {
o	  console.log("Hello World")
o	} 
o	
o	functionName();
•	Learning about global and non-global variables was interesting. If the variable is not assigned to a type even in the function then it will initialize it’s self as global
