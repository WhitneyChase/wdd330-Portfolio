<h1>Week 04 Notes</h1>
<h2>Javascript and object-oriented programming</h2> 
<p>Works very similarly to other languages, and the main parts to focus on are encapsulation and inheritance. You can use the ubiquitous object literal pattern                                                                                                             var object = { variable: “stuff”, otherVariable: “stuff”}; 
Or you can have a more dimensional object using the prototype method: 
Function blah blah () {} 
Function.object.thingInObjectYouWant = “blah blah blah”; 
-you can add a whole bunch of stuff in here which is cool.  
You can make classes which are labeled functions in javascript but they act likes classes. By using classes you can then have the all important inheritance properties. Encapsulation put simply is using a class(or in this case function) constructor. 
The Object.create method is really interesting, seeing how it inherits from the object that you pass into it.</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.</p>
<h2>Principles of OOP </h2>
<p>Encapsulation:  The implementation and state of each 
object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class. Other objects do not have access 
to this class or the authority to make changes
  
Abstraction: Objects only reveal information relevant for the use 
of the objects using them

Inheritance: When a child object has the same 
features or attributes as a parent object 
or an object that it takes attributes from 
so as not to have reduntant code. 

Polymorphism: Objects can shape shift depending on 
the situaiton that they are being used and what 
information is required of them. </p>
