AJAX 
•	Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML 
•	It is used for XMLHttpRequest objects that communicate with servers. 
•	It can send and receive information with many different objects such as JSON,XML,HTML, and text files. 
•	The cool thing about AJAX is that since it is asynchronous it can exchange and update information to and from the webpage without having to refresh the page.
•	After you send the request you will need to assign it to an onreadystatechange and a function. This will handle the response 
•	To actually send the request you would use get, post, head or something of that nature, then follow it by the url. 
o	httpRequest.open(‘GET’, ‘url’, optional 3rd parameter); 
o	httpRequest.send(); 
•	Youi have to make sure that when you send a request that it will be able to be read correctly. Such as sending a string that can be easily parsed.  
•	In the function that receives the request there are several things that you need to do. 
o	Check the requests state (different numbers indicating the completeness of the query) 
o	0 (uninitialized) or (request not initialized)
o	1 (loading) or (server connection established)
o	2 (loaded) or (request received)
o	3 (interactive) or (processing request)
o	4 (complete) or (request finished and response is ready)
•	You would then check the http response such as a 200, 404, 500 to see if the response is being read.
•	Once you have the request that has been returned there are many different ways to manipulate it so that you can access the information in the way that you want.
