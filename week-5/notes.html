<h1>Week 05 Notes</h1>
<h2>JavaScript Debugging Tips:</h2>
<p>
•	You can use a console log to have text and to print out a certain variable
•	You can also use debugger breakpoints
•	You can use console logs and breakpoint together like this
o	Console.log(‘’);
o	Console.log(‘’);
o	Debugger;
o	Console.log(‘’);
•	This helps you to have a better idea of where exactly your code is breaking.
•	You can also use conditional line-of-code breakpoints
o	Label.textContent = addend1 +  ‘+’  +  addend2 +  ‘ = ‘  + sum; 

JavaScript Testing Tips: 
•	You can use testing frameworks to provide tools to make this more automated and easier.
o	Unit.js
o	QUnit
o	Jasmine 
o	AVA
o	Mocha
o	Are a few of the frameworks that you can choose from
•	You can also write specific unit tests for a specific function or element. This is done through browser or on the frontend
•	Unit tests are organized in suits. Kind of like a folder of similar unit tests or all the tests for one feature.
•	Here is an example of a unit test from “https://alistapart.com/article/writing-testable-javascript/” 
o	def test_search 
o	fill_in('q', :with => 'cat') 
o	find('.btn').click 
o	assert( find('#results li').has_content?('cat'), 'Search results are shown' ) 
o	assert( page.has_no_selector?('#results li.no-results'), 'No results is not shown' ) end
•	Depending on the framework that you choose to work with will depend on how you call and implement your tests. It can be as simple as importing a test.js file, or a series of catches and throws.
