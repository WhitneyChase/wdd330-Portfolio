These css tools were cool to learn about. 
I normally hate css but the transitions were cool. 
You can have the duration of the transition, you can change how the element will change when it enters or leaves the page with transforms.  
The drag and drop functions are also cool and a lot easier than I expected. Just a function call and some booleans.
