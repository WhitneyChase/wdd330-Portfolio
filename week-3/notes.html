JavaScript W03 notes

Objects: An object is a variable with multiple values. These values are often in key, word pairs. They can be written in a linear line or a block, and the value can be accessed either by brackets or the dot. They can also have ACTIONS! This can be as simple as making a function to return the users full name. This as far as I can tell can only be used on the other variables that are in the same object. Also objects are initialized with an “=” before the brackets. 
Example:
1.	var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  id       : 5566,
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

Events: are preloaded actions that can be called to execute certain functions Such as onclick for when a user’s clicks a button, or onload to load a certain something when the browser has finished loading. 

DOM: is a world wide document accessing procedure. Essentially when the browser processes a text file with code like an html page that it the D component the actual document, the O or objects can be found in the html document as the different tags. These tags are arranged in a certain hierarchy, or an order in which they will be executed. Javascript messes with that hierarchy and it can call certain tags to alter and they will be executed sooner than they would have if they had not been used in a javascript function. 
This: I never knew that this could be so diverse. It can be used globally, when initializing new instances of an object, and many many other instances. You wouldn’t really use the global form of this, and it can be used in broad and narrow scopes. It mostly allows you to access parts of a function without being in scope. You can further manipulate this by pairing it with “bind”.
