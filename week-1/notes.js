I thought that I had considered mobile design beofre watching the video but afterwards I really had to go back to the drawing board and think about the user experience and what would not 
only be pleasing for them to look at but also be an enjoyable experience for them as well. Enjoyable for their other senses is what I mean, things like thumb reach, and having intuitive
designs that make it so the user can focus on things other than just the app they are interacting with. I had thought about how to make the add space in mobile apps more enjoyable
the video sparked some thought but I'm not yet sold on the correct way to implement that better. 

Learning about this type of array in javascript var someNumbers = [25, 11, -2, 14, "what?? This isn't a number!", -1, -10]
was super cool, concatinating inside of an array?! What? That was really neat and I think that it could be really beneficial as well in the future. 


I didn't really understand the book so I found this website https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage 
that explained it fairly well. 
Though it did lead me to consider the difference between local and session storage which lead to this article https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/localstorage-vs-sessionstorage-c22164aff067

summary: 
Local storage: data never expires and is saved between tabs with the same origin
Session storage: the data will only live in that tab and through refreshes but not the actual closing of tabs. The information will also be daved in the media components of the 
tab as well. 

The portfolio is a struggle I will need to do more study on the actual presenting of it.
